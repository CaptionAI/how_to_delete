# How To Delete

In Caption AI, we prioritize user accessibility and data control. While we currently do not have a direct feature for account deletion within the app, we ensure you can manage your data effectively.

You have the ability to log out of your account at any point in time. However, if you wish to delete your account and all associated personal information, such as your email, password, and username, please reach out to our customer support team directly.

Once we receive your request for account deletion, we will promptly process it and permanently remove your data from our servers, respecting your privacy and digital rights.

Remember, your trust is our utmost priority, and we are continually working on enhancing our features to provide you with complete control over your data. Please stay tuned for updates regarding this and other exciting improvements coming to Caption AI.
